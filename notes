- npm init vue@latest and follow instructions
- npx vite - runs a dev server

* .vue files are kept inside the views dir. THey are known as 'single file components'. You do not need use export default{
and include everything inside <script> tags.
* set aliases in the vite.config file to avoid having to type out long paths for imports, all of the time.
* phpstoem used to need a jsonconfig.json entry to recognise the aliases but doesn't seem to now??
* By convention a component which is a one time use component, it has The in the name.

* in vue 3 we now have the composition API for building our vue applications as well as the options API which has
always existed and which we have been using.
    - the composition defines components' logic by importing API functions. It is typically done with <script setup>
    - we can remove all data() methods: {} etc by using <script setup> and simply including out methods and vars within it.
    We now use ref() to define reactivity on a var. It will not be reactive by default. There is the experimental
    reactivityTransform flag we can set in vite.config to allow to use the $ref method instead globally, meaning that
    we don't even have to import ref in our components. We now have to use .value on our data props in order to change them
